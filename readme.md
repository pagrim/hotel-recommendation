# Hotel Recommendation

## Summary
This is a simple example of a recommendation system based on a question I came across recently. The question and recommender system are outlined in the `recommend.ipynb` notebook.

## How to run the Notebook
I used an ipykernal called "recommend" to run this notebook. You can do the same by running the commands below in the directory contained the cloned repository
```
python -m venv .venv # Create a virtual environment
. .venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # install requirements
python -m ipykernel install --user --name recommend # create ipykernel
jupyter notebook # Start a local notebook
```
